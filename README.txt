First Drupal Twig Theme
------------------------

This is the first Drupal Twig theme ever created.  It was created by hand at
DrupalCon Portland, 2013, based on the MEGAPATCH that was committed on Friday
During the code sprint.  This MEGAPATCH changed Drupal's default template engine
from PHPTemplate to Twig.

That said, this theme is *extremely* experimental, and will probably be obsolete
even before Drupal 8 is released.

Installation
------------

To install this theme, please clone it into your /themes/ directory.  (In Drupal 8
core themes have been moved into /core/themes/ so your themes *do* go in the root
/themes/ directory).

There is a known bug in Drupal 8 that this theme will not work when placed into
a /sites/default/themes/ directory, or a /sites/sub-site.com/themes/ directory.
That bug will be resolved before Drupal 8 is released.

Warantee
--------

None whatsoever. Seriously.
